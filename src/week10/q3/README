To run password modification:

Start with compiling and running PasswordWrite.java with argument file name 1234.ser
This creates a file and asks for pass word and then stores the password  in the file along with the code for the string
Now, we can test by running PasswordRead.java and passing the file name(1234.ser)
if the password is changed, it will show a prompt that password has been changed.

We can modify password by using ModifyPassword file and passing as argument, the new password which we want to update.

This file reads the password from the given user input filename 1234.ser and updates the new password and writes into the file.
