Q1. Why would the program not compile, if the line ’does not compile’ would be commented in?
A1.
A) Line 13 "return 3;" does not compile because it is unreachable. The try block of method noSystemExit() always
throws an exception which results in the execution of the catch block. Due to the return statement in the catch
block "return 0", jvm completes the finally block and returns to the caller of the method with value "0" returned in
catch block.
B) Line 24 "return 3;" if commented, the program will not compile because the function expects a return value of type
int. In this case the execution goes from try block to finally block directly since no exception occurs and no return
value present in try or finally block.
C) Line 55 "return 3;" does not compile because it is unreachable. Since after array index out of bound exception
in the try block, the control directly goes to the finally block which has a return value of 2,it does not execute any
further lines in the function. The control is given back to the caller of the function with return value 2.

Q2. Explain the execution of each method in writing.

A2.
A) Method noSystemExit():
A private method with no parameters and expected return type of integer. In the try block, an exception is thrown always
with message as "1" which will be caught by the catch block which is printing string "2" and a return value 0.
The finally is executed before returning to the caller of the method and it prints "3 finally". Control again goes to
the return value in the catch block and 0 is returned.

B) Method noExeption():
A private method with no parameters and expected return type of integer. There is no exception in this method, after
execution of the try block with print statement "inside try: 1", control directly goes to the finally block which prints
"inside finally: 3 ". The return statement at the of the function is executed and control is passed back to the caller
with value 3.

C) Method anExeption1():
A private method with no parameters and expected return type of integer. anArray is defined & created with size 1 and
in the try block we are trying to divide with a denominator 0 which will cause an ArithmeticException, control goes to
the catch block in which we are trying to access the index 2 which will produce an IndexOutOfBoundsException which is not
being caught. The control directly goes to the finally block and the print statement is printed "inside finally: 3 "
and the return value 2 is returned to the caller.

D) Method anExeption2():
A private method with no parameters and expected return type of integer. anArray is defined & created with size 1 and
in the try block we are trying to access the index 2 which will produce an IndexOutOfBoundsException which is not being
caught. Control goes directly to finally block after try and the string "inside finally: 3 " is printed with return
value 2.

E) Method withSystemExit():
A private method with no parameters and no expected return type. An exception is thrown in the try block which is caught
by the catch block. "5" is printed and the program exits withe status 0 after this. Finally block and the print
statement at the of the function never executes in this case.
